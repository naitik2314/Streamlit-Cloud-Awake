# 🌐 Random Text Selector with Selenium

This Python-based project leverages the **Selenium WebDriver** to visit a website, perform random text selection, and revisit the website at random intervals between **6 to 24 hours**. The script highlights randomly selected visible text on the page and mimics human-like behavior by scrolling and interacting with the page.
